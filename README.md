# Django + React Full Stack Stock Prediction Portal

## 1. Overview

This is a full-stack web application that is build using React (Frontend) and Django (Backend). The portal allows users to:
- Register new accounts and log in securely using JWT authentication. 
-  Access a dashboard after log in where they can input a valid stock ticker for price prediction. 
- View the results and dynamically generated plots including stock price trends and moving averages. 

The core idea of the project is to demonstrate how to intergrate pre-trained machine learning models in Django with a modern frontend, connnected via axis.
